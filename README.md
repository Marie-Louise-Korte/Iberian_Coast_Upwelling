## Project Abstract

Eastern boundary upwelling systems are among the most productive ocean regions globally. They support large fisheries and play an important role in carbon cycling. The Iberian Peninsula is located in the north of the Canary Current System, one of the four global eastern boundary upwelling systems. During the upwelling season from June to September, the ocean-land pressure gradient along the Iberian Peninsula intensifies, strengthening northerly winds that drive off-shore Ekman transport and create coastal upwelling. The near-shore water is transported off-shore and replaced with cold, deep-water leaving a signature in coastal sea surface temperature (SST). Studies based on global climate models predict an intensification of upwelling in this region over the twenty-first century. This study evaluates the trends in upwelling using two indices, one based on Ekman transport (UIEk) and the other on SST data (UISST). Over the period 1982-2022, there are no significant trends in the upwelling indices. When the study period is extended to 1940-2023 a negative trend in UIEk and a positive trend in UISST emerges. While reanalysis and observational data do not yet show conclusive trends, the analysis of sea level pressure showed that extreme upwelling events coincide with an atmospheric state that is likely to occur more frequently under climate change. Extreme upwelling events are associated with a more northerly position of the oceanic subtropic high-pressure system. It is therefore reasonable to assume that upwelling will strengthen in this region, as is predicted by modelling studies.
